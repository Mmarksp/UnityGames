- Once upon a time, I encountered a chicken.
*	Naturally, I went up and killed it.
	I grabbed hold of its leg and willed the beast in a motion slamming its head into a rock. 
	The noise was that of a discrete 'thump'. 
	* *		With the chicken unconsciouss, I made for the axe on the wall in my garage.
			I had forgotten to clean it after last time. The bloodied feathers stared back at me in a sort-of wilted way.
		* *		I wiped the surface clean.
		* *		I left the surface untouched.
		- -		With a firm grip, I went over to the still shape.
				These feathers stared yet at noone. I lift the axe
		* *		And bring it down with great strength
				Blood was absorbed into the floor, infecting the air and sullying the aura of the house
*	Cautiously, I took one step forward and greeted it.
	The chicken looked at me expectantly, 'buck-buck-buck-buuuuck?'
	I could hear myself say
	* *		'what is it that you expect of me?'
	* *		'what is your name?
